# I read Henry Baker's paper *Equal Rights for Functional Objects or, The More Things Change, The More They Are the Same*
# and got a wild hair about `egal`.  However, it turns out that in McCarthy's Lisp the idea is trivial to the extreme.  Oh well...
# it's still a great paper.  [Clojure](http://clojure.org)'s creator Rich Hickey summarizes `egal` much more succinctly than I ever could:
#
# > ... the only things you can really compare for equality are immutable things, because if you compare two things for equality that
# > are mutable, and ever say true, and they're ever not the same thing, you are wrong.  Or you will become wrong at some point in the future.
#
# Pretty cool huh?
